# Code Book
========================================================

## run_analysis.R code has most of the code commented... which should be self explanatory
        I have used data.table package
        The code, gets and merges, test and training data + adds explanatory column names
        
        You can also see the output here..
        
        Thanks... Will update more when I get a chance...
